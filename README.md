## About

This is a simple Rumble clone project built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and RapidAPI that offers a functional replica of the popular video sharing platform, Rumble. With this clone, you can easily view videos, search for content, and visit user channels, all in a user-friendly and responsive interface.

I created this project as part of my ongoing efforts to improve my web development skills using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a great example of how these powerful tools can be used to create intuitive and interactive web applications.

To power the video content in this clone, I utilized RapidAPI's Youtube API since there is no public API available for accessing Rumble videos. Although the videos are sourced from Youtube, the app successfully replicates the design and features of Rumble's video platform, giving users a familiar and seamless experience.

Please feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs.
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Rumble clone!
